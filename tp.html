        <p> Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 - 1 February 2003) was an Indian-born American astronaut and aerospace engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to fly to space.[3][4] She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator aboard STS-87.[5] Chawla's second flight was in 2003 on STS-107, the final flight of Columbia. She was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003.Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor,and several streets, universities, and institutions are named in her honor.

        In 1988, Chawla joined NASA's Ames Research Center, where she initially conducted computational fluid dynamics research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. Much of Chawla's research is included in technical journals and conference papers. In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc. as vice president and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. Chawla held an FAA Flight Instructor certificate with airplane and glider ratings, and a Commercial Pilot certificate with single and multi-engine airplane, seaplane, and glider ratings. After she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, Chawla applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps.She joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected for her first flight in 1997.
